# Using the BizTalk Services Portal
[!INCLUDE[azure_1](/Token/azure_1_md.md)] has an [!INCLUDE[azportal](/Token/azportal_md.md)] to create services, websites, databases, and so on. [!INCLUDE[af_integration](/Token/af_integration_md.md)] has its own portal - the [!INCLUDE[af_integration](/Token/af_integration_md.md)] portal. To open the [!INCLUDE[af_integration](/Token/af_integration_md.md)] portal:

1. In the [!INCLUDE[azportal](/Token/azportal_md.md)] ([http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=213885](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=213885)), select your BizTalk Service.

2. In the task bar, select **Manage**.

The [!INCLUDE[af_integration](/Token/af_integration_md.md)] portal allows users to:

**Register your [!INCLUDE[af_integration](/Token/af_integration_md.md)] deployment**

Using the [!INCLUDE[azportal](/Token/azportal_md.md)], you create a BizTalk Service. When the BizTalk Service is created, you “register” your deployment in the [!INCLUDE[af_integration](/Token/af_integration_md.md)] portal. The [!INCLUDE[af_integration](/Token/af_integration_md.md)] portal provides an easy and convenient user interface for all your [!INCLUDE[af_integration](/Token/af_integration_md.md)] applications. You can also add users to share the management tasks of your [!INCLUDE[af_integration](/Token/af_integration_md.md)] deployments.

**Manage resources uploaded to the [!INCLUDE[af_integration](/Token/af_integration_md.md)] subscription**

Using the [!INCLUDE[tpm_portal](/Token/tpm_portal_md.md)], you can:

- Add/delete bridges, including bridges deployed from your project.

- Upload/delete schemas, transforms, assemblies, and certificates.

- View tracked messages, including active and completed batches.

- Search for partners, agreements, and bridges that you deployed or added.

- Enable additional settings, like **Encryption at Rest**.

**Create and manage business-to-business (B2B) operations**

Using the [!INCLUDE[tpm_portal](/Token/tpm_portal_md.md)], you can easily manage and onboard trading partners for business-to-business messaging. With the [!INCLUDE[tpm_portal](/Token/tpm_portal_md.md)], customers are able to cut down the on-boarding time from weeks to days. You can also leverage Microsoft hosted B2B pipelines as services to exchange B2B documents and run them at scale for customers. This minimizes overhead in managing B2B pipelines and their corresponding scale issues with dedicated servers. To manage B2B operations using the [!INCLUDE[tpm_portal](/Token/tpm_portal_md.md)], see [EDI, AS2, and EDIFACT Messaging &#40;Business to Business&#41;](/Topic/EDI,_AS2,_and_EDIFACT_Messaging__Business_to_Business).md).

This section provides instructions on how to perform these tasks using the [!INCLUDE[tpm_portal](/Token/tpm_portal_md.md)].
