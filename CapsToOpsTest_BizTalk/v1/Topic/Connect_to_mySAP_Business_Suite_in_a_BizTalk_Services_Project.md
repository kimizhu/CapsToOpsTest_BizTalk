# Connect to mySAP Business Suite in a BizTalk Services Project
There are three overall steps to connect to mySAP Business Suite application from a [!INCLUDE[af_integration](/Token/af_integration_md.md)] project.

- Create an [!INCLUDE[lobtarget](/Token/lobtarget_md.md)] for mySAP Business Suite.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > - To create an [!INCLUDE[lobtarget](/Token/lobtarget_md.md)] for SAP, you must be a member of the local Administrators group and have the System Administrator right on the on-premises SAP system.
   > - Visual Studio must be opened with Administrative privileges.
   > - On a 64-bit server, also install the 32-bit SAP client libraries to the *drive*:\Windows\SysWOW64 folder.

- Use the [!INCLUDE[lobtarget](/Token/lobtarget_md.md)]

- Generate schema for the operation to be performed on the SAP application.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These steps assume you have a [!INCLUDE[sb2](/Token/sb2_md.md)] namespace. [Install Azure BizTalk Services SDK](/Topic/Install_Azure_BizTalk_Services_SDK.md) lists the requirements.

### To add an [!INCLUDE[lobtarget](/Token/lobtarget_md.md)] for mySAP Business Suite

1. In Server Explorer, expand **[!INCLUDE[lobconnect](/Token/lobconnect_md.md)]**, expand the Management URL, and then expand **LOB Types**.

2. Right-click **SAP** and select **Add SAP Target**. The **Add a Target** wizard opens:

   1. In the Welcome window, select **Next**.

   2. In Connection Parameters, enter the following:

      - **Application Server**: The server name or IP address of the SAP server.

      - **System Number**: The SAP system number.

      - **Client**: The SAP client number.

      - **Language**: The SAP language.

      - **Advanced**: Select this button to configure additional Connection Properties and any Binding Properties.

         > [!IMPORTANT]
         > The SAP adapter supports the following client connection types:
         > 
         > - **A**: An application host-based connection to SAP.
         > - **B**: A load balanced connection to SAP.
         > - **D**: A destination-based connection using the destination in the saprfc.ini file to SAP.

      ![](/Image/AI_AddSAPLob.gif)

      The following links provide additional details on selecting an operation:

      [Browsing, Searching, and Retrieving Metadata for RFC Operations](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=228978)

      [Browsing, Searching, and Retrieving Metadata for BAPI Operations](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=228979)

      [Browsing, Searching, and Retrieving Metadata for IDOC Operations](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=228980)

      [Browsing, Searching, and Retrieving Metadata for tRFC Operations](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=228981)

      To see the operationâ€™s generated WSDL, select the operation, and select **Properties**.

      Select **Next**.

   4. In Runtime Security, enter the security type. This security type determines how the client message is authenticated with the [!INCLUDE[lobtarget](/Token/lobtarget_md.md)]. Options include:

      |||
      |-|-|
      |Fixed Username <br /> <br />|Select this option if you are using a username and password created locally on the LOB system. <br /> <br />|
      |Custom SOAP Header <br /> <br />|Select this option if you create a custom SOAP header to include the username and password. <br /> <br />|
      |Message Credential <br /> <br />|Select this option if you are including the logon credentials in the WS-Security header of the message. <br /> <br />|
      Select **Next**.

   5. In Deployment, choose an existing [!INCLUDE[lobrelay](/Token/lobrelay_md.md)] or create a new [!INCLUDE[lobrelay](/Token/lobrelay_md.md)].

      > [!TIP]
      > A single [!INCLUDE[lobrelay](/Token/lobrelay_md.md)] can be used with multiple [!INCLUDE[lobtarget](/Token/lobtarget_md.md)]s. There are restrictions based on the security model. As a best practice, group the same security method in one [!INCLUDE[lobrelay](/Token/lobrelay_md.md)]. For example, use the same [!INCLUDE[lobrelay](/Token/lobrelay_md.md)] to host the [!INCLUDE[lobtarget](/Token/lobtarget_md.md)]s that use Message Credential or Fixed Windows security type.

      To create a new [!INCLUDE[lobrelay](/Token/lobrelay_md.md)]:

      |||
      |-|-|
      |Namespace <br /> <br />|**Required**. Enter your [!INCLUDE[sb2](/Token/sb2_md.md)] namespace. The namespace name is available in the [Azure classic portal](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=517414). <br /> <br />|
      |Issuer Name <br /> <br />|**Required**. A valid [!INCLUDE[sb2](/Token/sb2_md.md)] Issuer Name is required. <br /> <br />|
      |Issuer Secret <br /> <br />|**Required**. A valid [!INCLUDE[sb2](/Token/sb2_md.md)] Issuer Secret key is required. <br /> <br />|
      |Relay Path <br /> <br />|**Required**. Enter the desired name of the relay path. For example, if you use chose Fixed Windows credentials option for Runtime Security, you can enter something like *WindowsAuthRelay*. <br /> <br />|
      |Target Sub-path <br /> <br />|**Required**. Enter a sub-path to make this target unique. For example, you can enter *GetOrder*. <br /> <br />|
      |Target runtime URL <br /> <br />|This is automatically populated with the namespace name, relay path and target sub-path specified. If using the examples above, it is populated with something like: <br /> <br />`https://MyNamespace.servicebus.windows.net/WindowsAuthRelay/GetOrder` <br /> <br />|
      Select **Next**.

   6. Summary shows your configured values. Select **Create**.

   7. When complete, select **Finish**. The following activities occur in the background:

      - The [!INCLUDE[lobtarget](/Token/lobtarget_md.md)] is created in Server Explorer. It can be disabled, started, and deleted. Its configuration can also be exported.

      - The [!INCLUDE[lobtarget](/Token/lobtarget_md.md)] is created as an application in IIS. This application uses the Runtime for this specific [!INCLUDE[lobtarget](/Token/lobtarget_md.md)]. [Runtime Components: BizTalk Adapter Service](/Topic/Runtime_Components__BizTalk_Adapter_Service.md) describes the IIS components.

### To use the [!INCLUDE[lobtarget](/Token/lobtarget_md.md)]

1. Right-click anywhere on the [!INCLUDE[msgflow_proj](/Token/msgflow_proj_md.md)] design area, select **Properties**, and update the **BizTalk Service URL** property to include your [!INCLUDE[af_integration](/Token/af_integration_md.md)] name. This is the name that you entered in [Azure classic portal](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=517414) when creating the [!INCLUDE[af_integration](/Token/af_integration_md.md)].

2. Set the security property for the relay endpoint:

   1. Right-click the relay endpoint in Server Explorer, and select **Properties**.

   2. In the Properties grid, select the ellipsis **(â€¦)** next to the **Runtime Security** property.

   3. In the **Edit Security** dialog box, select the security method you want to use, and enter their values.

   4. Select **OK**.

3. Drag and drop the [!INCLUDE[lobtarget](/Token/lobtarget_md.md)] onto the design area. Note the **Entity Name** property of the [!INCLUDE[lobtarget](/Token/lobtarget_md.md)]. The default value of the property is *Relay-Path_target-sub-path*.

4. Open the .config file for the LOB target, which typically has the *RelayPath_target-sub-path.config* name. Enter the [!INCLUDE[sb2](/Token/sb2_md.md)] issuer name and issuer secret, as shown:

   ```
   <tokenProvider>
     <sharedSecret issuerName="owner" issuerSecret="issuer_secret" />
   </tokenProvider>
   ```
   Save changes to the config file.

Once a [!INCLUDE[lobtarget](/Token/lobtarget_md.md)] is configured and added to the design area, add a [!INCLUDE[one-way](/Token/one-way_md.md)] or a [!INCLUDE[request_response](/Token/request_response_md.md)] to be the source. Use **Connector** in the Toolbox to connect the [!INCLUDE[bridge](/Token/bridge_md.md)] to the [!INCLUDE[lobtarget](/Token/lobtarget_md.md)], similar to the following:

![](/Image/AI_MFConnectionLOB.jpg)

[Create an XML One-Way Bridge](/Topic/Create_an_XML_One-Way_Bridge.md) and [Create an XML Request-Reply Bridge](/Topic/Create_an_XML_Request-Reply_Bridge.md) provide more specific information on the [!INCLUDE[xml_bridge](/Token/xml_bridge_md.md)] and any additional properties that must be configured.

> [!TIP]
> The [!INCLUDE[bridge](/Token/bridge_md.md)] uses the **Relative Address** property of the [!INCLUDE[lobtarget](/Token/lobtarget_md.md)] to send messages to the on-premises LOB system.

### To generate the schema

1. In the [!INCLUDE[msgflow_proj](/Token/msgflow_proj_md.md)], in the **Server Explorer**, right click the [!INCLUDE[lobtarget](/Token/lobtarget_md.md)] you created, and then select **Add schemas to &#42;&lt;project_name&gt;&#42;**. The **Schema Generation** dialog opens.

2. Enter a file name prefix. This value is prefixed with all the schema files that are generated. You can also enter the folder name under which the schemas are added in the Visual Studio Solution Explorer. The default value for the folder is **LOB Schemas**.

3. Select a credential type to generate the schema, enter the values for authentication, and then select **OK**.

   The schemas are added to the project under the folder name.
