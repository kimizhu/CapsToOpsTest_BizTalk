# Step 4: Configure a Request-Reply Bridge
This section of the tutorial lists the steps to configure an [!INCLUDE[request_response](/Token/request_response_md.md)]. There are two parts to an [!INCLUDE[request_response](/Token/request_response_md.md)]: a *request* bridge and a *response* bridge. The *request* bridge configures how a [!INCLUDE[bridge](/Token/bridge_md.md)] receives a message, processes it, and sends the message to the destination. The *response* bridge configures how the [!INCLUDE[bridge](/Token/bridge_md.md)] receives a response message from the relay services, processes it, and then sends it back the original message sender.
