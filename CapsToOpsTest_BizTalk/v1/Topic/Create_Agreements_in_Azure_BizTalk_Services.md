# Create Agreements in Azure BizTalk Services
An agreement is defined as a contract between two trading partners for transacting messages over B2B Protocols. An agreement contains the technical details of configuration between two partners for exchanging EDI, AS2, and EDIFACT transactions. The TPA defines the settings for both sending and receiving messages. A TPA involves defining the agreement settings including transport settings and the pipeline definitions (transform and route settings) between the partners.

The topics in this section provide instructions on how to create an agreement.
