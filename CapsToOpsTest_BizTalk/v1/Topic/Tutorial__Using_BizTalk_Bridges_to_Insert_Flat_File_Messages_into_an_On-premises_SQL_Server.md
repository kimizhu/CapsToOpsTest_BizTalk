# Tutorial: Using BizTalk Bridges to Insert Flat File Messages into an On-premises SQL Server
This tutorial provides instructions on how to configure a [!INCLUDE[af_integration](/Token/af_integration_md.md)] solution that receives a flat-file message from an FTP server, processes it through a [!INCLUDE[bridge](/Token/bridge_md.md)] deployed under the [!INCLUDE[af_integration](/Token/af_integration_md.md)] subscription on [!INCLUDE[azure_1](/Token/azure_1_md.md)], and then inserts the message into an on-premises [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](/Token/ssNoVersion_md.md)] database.

## Business Scenario
Fabrikam and Contoso are two business partners. Fabrikam (the retailer) sends sales order messages to Contoso (the supplier). Contoso maintains all the sales order data in table called Orders, which is housed in a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](/Token/ssNoVersion_md.md)] database within Contosoâ€™s premises. Fabrikam sends flat-file messages to Contoso using an FTP server. Hence, Contoso has to implement a solution that enables the following:

- Contoso must pull the flat file messages from the FTP server at which Fabrikam drops the sales order messages.

- Contoso must process the message received from Fabrikam and map it to the message for inserting the sales order in its [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](/Token/ssNoVersion_md.md)] database.

To enable this scenario, Contoso does the following:

- Generates the schema of the flat-file message that it will receive from Fabrikam.

- Configures an [!INCLUDE[one-way](/Token/one-way_md.md)] as part of the [!INCLUDE[msgflow_proj](/Token/msgflow_proj_md.md)] to enable message validation and transformation. This [!INCLUDE[bridge](/Token/bridge_md.md)] takes a flat-file message, validates it against the schema generated earlier, and then transforms it to the schema required to enter a message into the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](/Token/ssNoVersion_md.md)] database.

- Uses [!INCLUDE[lobconnect](/Token/lobconnect_md.md)] to connect to the on-premise [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](/Token/ssNoVersion_md.md)] database from the [!INCLUDE[one-way](/Token/one-way_md.md)] deployed under the [!INCLUDE[af_integration](/Token/af_integration_md.md)] subscription.
