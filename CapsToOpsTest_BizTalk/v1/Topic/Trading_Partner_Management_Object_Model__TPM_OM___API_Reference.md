# Trading Partner Management Object Model (TPM OM): API Reference
The [!INCLUDE[tpm_full](/Token/tpm_full_md.md)] offers a rich user experience to create and manage partners and agreements for business-to-business messaging. However, at times you need to programmatically create the different entities that are part of [!INCLUDE[tpm_portal](/Token/tpm_portal_md.md)]. [!INCLUDE[af_integration_full](/Token/af_integration_full_md.md)] offers a WCF Data Service-based object model to programmatically create and maintain different entities such as partners, agreements, and so on for the [!INCLUDE[tpm_portal](/Token/tpm_portal_md.md)]. This section provides information about the different entities, and their properties, that are exposed using the WCF Data Services. This section also provides the sequence of steps that you must perform to create the entities programmatically.
